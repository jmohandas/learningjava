### Topics covered

 - Type casting
   - Narrowing  (Casting from a higher type to a lower data type)
   - Widening (Casting from a smaller data type to a higher data type)
 - Autoboxing and Unboxing
    - Autoboxing is automatically converting a primitive type to it's wrapper class
    ```java
    Integer someNo = 23;
    ```
    Here the 23 is primitive `int` which is assigned to a wrapper class variable.
    - Unboxing is the reverse of the Autoboxing
    ```java
    Integer someNo = 23;
    int b = someNo;
    ```
